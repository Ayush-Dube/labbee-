## ✨Lab1

- MariaDB is a fork of MySQL, created by the original developers of MySQL. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL, meaning it's fully compatible with MySQL syntax and operations.
- MariaDB was created to ensure that a truly open-source version of MySQL would always be available. It maintains high compatibility with MySQL while also offering some unique features and improvements.
- For the purposes of this lab and most basic to intermediate MySQL operations, you can treat MariaDB exactly as you would MySQL. All the commands we'll use in this lab work identically in both MariaDB and MySQL.
- MariaDB is often considered more lightweight and faster than MySQL, which makes it an excellent choice for learning environments like this lab. You might notice quicker response times, which can make your learning experience smoother.
- Many Linux distributions, including some versions of Ubuntu, now use MariaDB as their default MySQL-compatible database system due to its open-source nature and performance benefits.
